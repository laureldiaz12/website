First, let's start with the basics of Python. We'll be working with the 'faithful' dataset - it's super easy!
```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(reticulate)
use_python("/usr/local/bin/python3", required = F)

```

```{python}
import pandas as pd
faithful=pd.read_csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/datasets/faithful.csv")
