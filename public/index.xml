      <description>Project 1: Analyzing Gender Representation in Marvel Comics The two datasets I have chosen to examine are “avengers” and “comic_characters_marvel”. The “avengers” dataset has 173 unique rows (characters) and 21 variables. However, after tidying my data, I chose to keep the ‘name’, ‘appearances’, ‘current’, ‘gender’, ‘year’, ‘years_since_joining’, and ‘honorary’ columns, since these would be the easiest to join with the “comic_characters_marvel” dataset. The “comic_characters_marvel” dataset has 16,376 unique rows (characters) and 15 variables.</description>

      <description>Candy Rankings Dataset This project uses the “candy_rankings” dataset in the package “fivethirtyeight” to understand statistical relationships between types of candy, sugar percentile, price percentile, pluribus (one of many candies in a box) and overall “win” percentage. As an emphatic lover of candy, I thought it would be incredibly interesting to see which candy types had the highest and lowest sugar percentages, which had the higher price percentages, and which were the overall winners.</description>
